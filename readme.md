Mini-Router
===========

A compact but powerful URI routing class, so you can have all your pages in one file.

The only requirements are an Apache webserver (Nginx will require some configuration if you'd like to use that instead) and PHP 5.3 or higher.

Examples are located in index.php, the comments should explain everything you need to know.
